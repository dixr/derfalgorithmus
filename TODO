- is there a better solution than showing a snackbar if totalconditionsprice > money in the pot?
- replace "-" button with Icons.delete_forever can at the end of each row on persons tab
- ask for confirmation when deleting
- move unnecessary code out of setState
- allow other currencies
- option to save / restore data (or just store data, for now)
